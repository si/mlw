**The one when Si talks to Silvia and Ely about VR first dates in the park, the well-being of candle making and why Shopify wasnâ€™t right for them.**

Silvia Costa and Ely Ochola - a couple from Surrey UK - have spent the last year through lockdown building a startup for selling candle-making workshops, meditation and even find the time away from day jobs to celebrate their achievements together.
