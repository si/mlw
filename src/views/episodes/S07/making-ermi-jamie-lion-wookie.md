Jamie & Lion and Wookie (aka Jamie Knight and Mike Southgate) have used their individual skills to collaborate on fraud detection service Ermi, that is now used by many fin-tech providers worth $6bn of payments every day. Jamie is also autistic which he's put to good use making the BBC Sounds podcast, 1800 Seconds on Autism. Following several life-changing experiences and many years working together, they bring us some fascinating insights to their lives along with some brilliant advice on how to collaborate together as friends.

_(Unfortunately, we had some technical issues with audio recordings so we've tried to make the most of secondary audio sources. Apologies for any audible nuances.)_
