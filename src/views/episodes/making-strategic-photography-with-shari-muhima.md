Shari Muhima is a brand strategist, originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, now living in London UK. Her career journey is a brilliant example of how to find your passions despite all the difficulties thrown your way. She's also a regular contributor in our [On The Side Slack community](http://ontheside.network/) so Si was keen to invite on to the podcast to tell us her stories.
