**The one when Si, Mike and Sam discuss their side project failures and consider whether side projects are a necessity for people working in tech.**

In the second episode of the fifth season, the boys get into the contentious topic of side projects as a prerequisite to tech jobs and discuss any projects that they had ideas of grandeur for them to fall by the way side.
