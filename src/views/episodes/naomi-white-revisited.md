Season 4 Episode 2 invites [Naomi White](http://brandedbynaomi.com) back to revisit how she’s been handling life through lockdown; professionally, personally and creatively. As always, a real inspiration for anyone who’s trying to find motivation in these tough times.

## Show Notes

- [Unfulfilled](https://brandedbynaomi.com/shop/unfulfilled) - a home for axed logomarks that deserve to be seen, in glorious printed magazine format.
