**The one when Si talks to Si about all the BBC talent we've met on this podcast, a pragmatic approach to IndieWeb data with WordPress & GraphQL and hacking away in-between episodes of Dragon's Den.**

Simon Scarfe – principal software engineer at Cinch (and another ex-BBC tech cohort) – joins us this week to talk about how he's been diving into personal habit tracking, observing trends with health and reading, even checking bin days.
