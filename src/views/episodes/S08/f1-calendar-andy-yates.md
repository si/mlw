**The one when Si talks to Andy about the crazy demand of Formula 1 race times, benefits of going open-source and paying the rent with sunset times.**

[Andy Yates](http://andydev.co.uk) and Si go way back to the mid-noughties as they met through the Birmingham web community, [Multipack](http://multipack.co.uk). Following an exciting time establishing his career as a web developer at 383, he then shifted to iOS development at [Buffer](http://buffer.com). In his own time, he continues to make a number of side projects including [F1 Calendar](http://f1calendar.com) and [Alpenglow](https://alpenglowapp.com).
