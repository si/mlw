This week, Si invites Dom Hodgson back to the podcast to talk about how he's been coping through lockdown with his family along with all the side projects he's got going on.

Please support his [rundom.run fundraising campaign](http://rundom.run) - running a half marathon in a stupid costume every Friday morning for 20 weeks, building up to "The Dopey" in Florida, all in the name of Martin House Hospice.
