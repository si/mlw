This week, I've invited along [Alex Brooke](https://alexy.me) for a little chat on how she's been getting on with the lockdown.

Alex is senior product designer at UK food delivery giant, Deliveroo. I've mostly known Alex through Twitter, regularly comparing notes across the London tech scene, but also with a shared passion for beautiful design and public speaking. I've long admired Alex's work and openness about her own wellbeing so I invited her along for a chat on the podcast which she has thankfully accepted.
