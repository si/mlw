For the _sixth_ episode (and first of the second series) of the Make Life Work podcast, Si talks to **Naomi White** (n√© Atkinson) - brand designer from Newcastle UK.

Naomi has been on a fascinating journey with her career, sharing similar qualifications as Si back in the early days of the Internet, working in London design agencies, freelancing with social good companies, up to now on side projects with her life partner, James White. We also touch on public speaking, building a business from scratch and even finding time for fitness.
