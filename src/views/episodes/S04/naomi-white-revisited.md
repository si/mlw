Season 4 Episode 2 invites [Naomi White](http://brandedbynaomi.com) back to revisit how she’s been handling life through lockdown; professionally, personally and creatively. As always, a real inspiration for anyone who’s trying to find motivation in these tough times.

## Show Notes

- [Starkade](https://starkade.com/) - a "chaos-infused" card game created with husband, James White (aka Signalnoise)
- [Unfulfilled](https://brandedbynaomi.com/shop/unfulfilled) - a home for axed logomarks that deserve to be seen, in glorious printed magazine format.
- [This is Minimum](https://thisisminimum.com/) - skincare product with school friend
