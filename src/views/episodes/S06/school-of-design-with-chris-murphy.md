**The one when Si talks to Chris about using his wealth of design and education background to setup his own school.**

Chris "Fehler" Murphy is no stranger to the design and education world, clocking up quite a few years of experience designing and educating others about modern digital design.

More recently, he's been working on a brand new School of Design plus a complimentary podcast called the Uneducators so, with all this in mind, Si invited Chris along to talk about his career, inspiration for his projects along with how he finds the time for family and other pass-times too.
