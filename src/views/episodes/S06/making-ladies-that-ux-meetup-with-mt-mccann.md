**The one when Si talked to Marie-Therese McCann about starting a meet-up in Belfast to find other UX women in tech.**

MT has been passionate about digital since the emergence of the Web and interactive multimedia in the 90s, carving out a fascinating career in UX since then and establishing a successful meet-up in Northern Ireland. As a sports coach and full time mummy, she has certainly found a healthy balance juggling work, life and side projects.
