**The one when Si talks to Lorna about sharing knowledge in open source, public speaking and everything in between.**

Lorna Mitchell has been working in the software industry as an engineer across many different disciplines, always a champion of open source solutions, now Head of Dev Rel at Aiven.

Her experience as an accomplished public speaker, published writer and open source advocate between her day job and hobbies felt like a natural guest for the podcast to share how she gives back to the community and encourages many to “pay it forward”.
