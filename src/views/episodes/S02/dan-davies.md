In the _tenth_ episode of the [Make Life Work podcast](https://sijobling.com/makelifework/), Si talks to **Dan Davies** - a web designer from North Wales. Dan reminisces over 80s childhoods, jumping between agency and freelance roles and bringing up two kids in a connected world.

**Disclaimer**: this was recorded in January before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. There are some references that could come across insensitive. There are some swear words too, hence why the show is marked as explicit.
