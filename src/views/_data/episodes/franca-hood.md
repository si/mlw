For **Season 4 Episode 3**, Si invites along clinical hypnotherapist, [Franca Hood](http://franca.uk/).

Franca doesn't necessarily work within tech but she's used tech in her career (which is a fascinating journey too) and also has plenty to share and apply to tech. Franca has also worked with Si to build a strong football community on Twitter plus found innovative ways to manage her time and family commitments.
